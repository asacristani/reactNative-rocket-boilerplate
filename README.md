# 🚩 Motivation
Reduce the boilerplate code for implementing common resources in mobile app development as navigation, storage,
security, auth and test.

# 🧩 Features

- **Navigation**: Auth stack and Home tab implemented by React Navigator.
- **Storage**: General storage with Redux, Redux-Persist and Secure Storage for sensitive data. 
- **Authentication**: Log-in and sign-up forms.
- **Folder structure**: Clean and organized workspace for extending and testing easier.
- **Rock-Solid Reliability**: Linters, Type checking, CI and unit/integration/component/e2e tests.
- **Deployment**: WIP

## 📁 Project Structure

This project follows a typical directory structure for a React Native app using Expo. Below is an overview of the project structure:

### Common use
- `App.js`: The main entry point of the application.
- `src/`: The source code of the application.
  - `components/`: Custom React components used in the app.
  - `navigation/`: Navigation-related components.
  - `screens/`: Application screens.
  - `store/`: Redux and Secure Storage.
- `assets/`: This directory contains various assets used in the app, such as icons and splash screens.
### Others
- `app.json`: The configuration file for Expo.
- `babel.config.js`: Configuration file for Babel.
- `package-lock.json`: Lockfile for project dependencies.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for project dependencies.


Feel free to adapt and extend this structure to meet the needs of your project.
